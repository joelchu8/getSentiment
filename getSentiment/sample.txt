If we look at our own solar system's galaxy, Milky Way, there is a black hole at the center of it that has a mass that equals to that of 250,0000 suns, and it's event horizon spans in many millions of kilometers. Theoretically, it is even possible for the Sun to become a black hole if its mass was less than the radius of the event horizon around it. It is important to notice that no one actually ever saw a black hole. Still, nonetheless, physicists are convinced in their existence.
The only thing that we actually can see is what is called an accretion disk. It is a disk-shaped flow of various space materials like gas and dust, which came close enough to the black hole but far enough to not fall into it. These halo-like matters surrounding the black hole are also called quasars, a neologism made up of "quasi-stellar radio source. " It is called like that because quasars were first discovered as radio-sources. They are also one of the oldest bodies in the universe, as well as the furthest and brightest of objects we can see.
